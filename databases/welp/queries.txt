You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

1. SELECT * FROM businesses, reviews, users WHERE reviews.businesses_id = businesses.id AND reviews.users_id = users.id;

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

2. SELECT users.First_name, users.Last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users JOIN reviews ON reviews.businesses_id = businesses.id AND reviews.users_id = users.id;
